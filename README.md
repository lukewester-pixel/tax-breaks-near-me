# Tax Breaks Near Me

Tax Breaks Near Me is a ZIP-code-personalized tax write-off suggestion engine.  
It pulls real nonprofit data from the **IRS Exempt Organizations Business Master File (BMF)** and demographic data from the **U.S. Census**, then generates three hyper-local charitable deduction ideas tailored to each ZIP.

This project includes:

- A smart backend (Python + Flask)
- A recommendation engine using IRS nonprofit data + Census demographics
- A web interface to allow anyone to input a ZIP and get suggestions
- A deployment-ready setup (Render compatible)
